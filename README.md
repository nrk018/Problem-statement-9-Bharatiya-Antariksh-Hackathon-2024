# Identification of Safe Navigation Routes on the Moon using Chandrayaan Images

Project Overview

This project aims to identify safe navigation routes on the Moon’s south pole region using optical and topographic datasets from the Chandrayaan-2 mission. The project focuses on analyzing and mapping a minimum 100-meter traverse path starting from the landing site coordinates (85.28° S, 31.20° E). The routes are designed to be free from hindrances such as boulders, craters, and steep slopes, ensuring safe navigation for a solar-powered rover.

Objectives

	•	Analyze terrain data from Chandrayaan-2:
	•	Terrain Mapping Camera (TMC)
	•	Digital Terrain Model (DTM)
	•	Optical High Resolution Camera (OHRC)
	•	Imaging Infra-red Spectrometer (IIRS)
	•	Design a rover traverse path with at least 10 stops for scientific examination.
	•	Optimize path planning considering rover specifications and solar power requirements.
	•	Create annotated maps/images depicting rover tracks, scientific stops, and major lunar features.
	•	Document the methodology, findings, and technical considerations.

Tools and Technologies

	•	GIS Software: QGIS and ArcMap for data visualization, analysis, and mapping.
	•	Programming Languages: Python for scripting and automation tasks related to data analysis.
	•	Data Formats: Raster images (TIFF) for optical data, DEM files for terrain models.
	•	Documentation: Markdown and LaTeX for technical documentation and reports.
	•	Version Control: GitHub for project repository management and collaboration.

Project Structure

	•	Data Acquisition: Download and prepare Chandrayaan-2 mission datasets.
	•	Data Analysis: Analyze terrain data to identify suitable rover traverse paths.
	•	Path Planning: Design and optimize rover paths considering safety and scientific objectives.
	•	Mapping and Annotation: Create annotated maps/images showing rover tracks and scientific stops.
	•	Documentation: Detail methodology, results, and technical considerations in project reports.

Future Enhancements

	•	Incorporate machine learning algorithms for automated path planning based on terrain data analysis.
	•	Expand analysis to include additional Chandrayaan-2 mission datasets for comprehensive lunar exploration.
